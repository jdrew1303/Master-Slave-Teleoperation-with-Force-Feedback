Abstract:

Intelligent and precise robotic systems are becoming essential for oper-
ating in harsh environments. In order to increase safety and machine
availability, robots can perform repetitive, unplanned and dangerous
tasks, which humans either prefer to avoid or are unable to carry out
due to hazards, size constraints, or the extreme environments in which
they take place.
A novel user-friendly system consisting of robotic arms that can be
operated by using other robotic arms as controllers, is presented in
my thesis. The system is equipped with force-feedback based haptic
devices and uses high-precision gravity compensation algorithms to
increase the stability during the robotic operations.
The force-feedback is realized through the utilization of impedance
control and to ensure the safety of the operator, the force is exerted
through virtual springs. Experiments to tune the force-feedback to
the operator have been implemented, as well as custom end-effector,
designed specifically for teleoperation.
